# About Me

Hellow everyone! My name is **Ivan Tsekahavoi**.
I am studeing in the BSU, the Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technologies. I am on my third year. My specialty is Applied Informatics. Among my qualities, I can single out scrupulousness and craving for knowledge. A bit lazy, which allows me to do work efficiently from the first time. At crucial moments, I am able to discard all distractions and fully concentrate on achieving the goal. Carefully disassemble the material, which is needed for my work. I am friendly with the exact sciences.
